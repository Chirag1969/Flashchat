## What we will learn

- How to incorporate Firebase into your Flutter projects.
- How to use Firebase authentication to register and sign in users.
- How to create beautiful animations using the Flutter Hero widget.
- How to create custom aniamtions using Flutter's animation controller.
- Learn all about mixins and how they differ from superclasses.
- Learn about Streams and how they work.
